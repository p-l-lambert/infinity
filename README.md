# infinity


Take Me To.. was founded by Team Infinity at Code First: Girls. It stemmed from our own holiday experiences, our attempts to discover entire new cities in just a few days.

Tour books and other travel websites give us unlimited options of what to see, what to do and where to eat when on holiday. 

It can take days just to filter through all the recommendations, and when you only have a couple you want to spend all your time exploring and doing things you love. 

Take Me To... gives you tried and tested day plans that you can use in whatever way you want as guides to what you can realistically fit in one day, and how you can best order your activities (and food stops!)
